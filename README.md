# CdhEmbargo
Parsing an official blacklisted persons file to make it readily available for identity resolution in CDH 

This is a small project I prepared for the product and solution management (this is also the reason for the lengthy explanations in the .rmd). It comes down to parsing an existing embargo list issued by the German government into a format that is usable by CDH (given the datamodel is fixed). Thus, companies are able to use CDH as a central service platform to adhere to compliance regulatories. 

This project contains the .rmd file, the .html output as well as the official .xml file.
